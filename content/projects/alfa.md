## Project Overview

**Duration:** Jan 2015â€“Dec 2015, continued through 2016  
**Organization:** National Security Institute Lab, Advanced project under Prof. Michalis Polychronakis  
**Type:** Security Research

## Description

Comprehensive security research project implementing advanced API hooking mechanisms for Windows application analysis. Started as ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) exploit mitigation research and expanded into a full security analysis framework under professor's guidance.

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Detours Express 3.0
- Visual Studio 2013
- Windows API hooking
- Python automation scripts
