## Project Overview

**Duration:** Aug 2014â€“Dec 2014  
**Course:** System Security  
**Team Size:** 2 members  
**Type:** Kernel Development

## Description

Added support for private threads in Linux kernel 3.17 for SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) systems, implementing thread-specific page tables with on-demand synchronization mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- Linux kernel 3.17
- C kernel programming
- SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) systems
- Memory management subsystems
- Page table manipulation

## Key Features Implemented

- **Thread-Specific Page Tables:** Individual memory spaces per thread
- **On-Demand Synchronization:** Efficient memory synchronization protocols
- **SMP Support:** Multi-processor system compatibility
- **Security Enhancement:** Improved thread isolation and privacy

## Key Achievements

- Successfully modified Linux kernel to support thread private storage
- Implemented efficient on-demand synchronization mechanisms
- Enhanced system security through improved thread isolation
- Maintained compatibility with existing SMP infrastructure
