## Project Overview

**Duration:** Jan 2015–May 2015  
**Course:** Operating System  
**Team Size:** 3 members  
**Type:** Systems Programming

## Description

Implemented a fully functional preemptive kernel for x86_64 architecture from scratch, including comprehensive system services and user-space utilities.

## Technologies Used

- x86_64 assembly language
- C systems programming
- Low-level hardware programming
- Memory management systems

## Key Features Implemented

- **Preemptive Scheduler:** Advanced process scheduling with time-slicing
- **Shell Interface:** Command-line interface for user interaction
- **Standard Libraries:** Custom libc implementation
- **Memory Management:** Page table management and virtual memory
- **Process Management:** Copy-on-write fork implementation
- **System Services:** Interrupt handling and system call interface

## Key Achievements

- Successfully created a working operating system kernel
- Implemented advanced memory management with copy-on-write optimization
- Developed comprehensive interrupt and system call handling
- Built user-space utilities and shell interface from ground up
